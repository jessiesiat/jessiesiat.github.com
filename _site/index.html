  <p><p>This post is gonna be about me programming in the past and maybe anyone could have the same experience as they start programming maybe during college schooling days.</p>

<p>To make the long story short! As part of our software design subject we are asked to create a software program.And I made an organization portal website and you know what these are the tools/resources I had during that time, let me list that one.</p>

<ul>
<li>Notepad (I dont use dreamweaver that time I dont know why?)</li>

<li>Books about PHP and MySQL</li>

<li>Beleive in my own</li>
</ul>

<p>And I made it in almost three months of coding! Passed the defense of it and able to graduate :)</p>

<p>Anyways thats not my point in here, as you can see in my list I use <code>notepad</code> as my primary editor of code, that is worst! No line number, code highlight, purely text. I am blind of any other opensource tools that I could had used during that time (there was even no suggestions from the instructor). Even though tools already exist that time just like dreamweaver or notepad++ for editor I just dont mind to use them. Whatever resource available on a typical machine is what I used. It was a big lost on me.</p>

<p>It was only after a year and more that I was made aware on the usefullness of using tools and opensource software in any programming activity. There comes Github which is popular on promoting(in a way) opensource software, collaboration and more. Really cool evolution in the programming world which makes it more socialize.</p>

<p>And with that after three years of programming, I now have a completely different and perfect workflow working as a developer. And these are the tools or resources I have today, let me list that one again.</p>

<p>Thats it! Lessons learn as we go along so just go on, continue with your passion and be happy!</p></p>

  <p><p>Ok, so what about Laravel? Who is Laravel? :D</p>

<p><a href='http://laravel.com/'>Laravel</a> is a PHP programming framework just like the popular <a href='http://rubyonrails.org/'>RoR</a> framework written in Ruby programming language.</p>

<p>It has taken the PHP community by storm and it is because of it&#8217;s cool developer friendly syntax and is up to date with the latest PHP version release. Let me list down what I love about Laravel.</p>

<ul>
<li>It has Fluent syntax</li>

<li>and Eloquent ORM</li>

<li>Based on latest PHP version release and component based (upcoming Laravel4)</li>

<li>Community driven and with cool core developer leads</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='fluent_syntax'>Fluent syntax</h3>

<p>Laravel has a fluent query builder for building SQL queries and working with the database. Don&#8217;t worry about SQL injection because it is protected upon and uses <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement'>prepared statements</a>. Query a table as easy with this syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$query = DB::table(&#39;users&#39;);</code></pre>

<p>Here were using <code>table</code> method inside the <code>DB</code> class of Laravel. With this you can now retrieve, insert, update, or delete records from &#8216;users&#8217; table.</p>

<p>For further reading <a href='http://laravel.com/docs/database/fluent'>read here</a></p>

<h3 id='eloquent_orm'>Eloquent ORM</h3>

<p>Laravel has the most advance PHP ORM(Object Relational Mapper) exists. All you need to do is to define a model for the table.</p>

<pre><code>class User extends Eloquent {}</code></pre>

<p>Without defining anything inside the class, Eloquent assumes that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the table has a primary key named <em>id</em></li>

<li>table name is the plural form of the model name</li>
</ul>

<p>Now to find a record by its <em>id</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$user = User::find(1);</code></pre>

<p>Getting excited! there&#8217;s more <a href='http://laravel.com/docs/database/eloquent'>here</a> for further reading.</p>

<h3 id='latest_php_and_component_based'>Latest PHP and Component Based</h3>

<p>PHP has a great dramatic improvement since the release of PHP5 that&#8217;s why Laravel was born.</p>

<p>The upcoming release of Laravel4 will now be component based and will now utilize the tool <a href='http://getcomposer.org/'>Composer</a> as it&#8217;s dependency manager.</p>

<h3 id='community_driven_and_with_cool_core_dev_leads'>Community driven and with cool core dev. leads</h3>

<p>Laravel was created first by Taylor Otwell and now has some added cool members namely Dayle Rees, Eric Barnes, Ian Landsman, Jason Lewis and Shawn McCool.</p>

<p>And many other <a href='https://github.com/laravel/laravel/graphs/contributors'>contributors..</a></p></p>

  <p><p>This is where I gonna be blogging away everything I want to. Mostly would be about PHP and web development which is my primary passion when in front of a computer.</p>

<p>More to come soon! </p></p>
