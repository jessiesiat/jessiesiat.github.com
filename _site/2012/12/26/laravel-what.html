	      <h3><a href="" class="post">Laravel, What???</a></h3>
	      <p>Ok, so what about Laravel? Who is Laravel? :D</p>

<p><a href='http://laravel.com/'>Laravel</a> is a PHP programming framework just like the popular <a href='http://rubyonrails.org/'>RoR</a> framework written in Ruby programming language.</p>

<p>It has taken the PHP community by storm and it is because of it&#8217;s cool developer friendly syntax and is up to date with the latest PHP version release. Let me list down what I love about Laravel.</p>

<ul>
<li>It has Fluent syntax</li>

<li>and Eloquent ORM</li>

<li>Based on latest PHP version release and component based (upcoming Laravel4)</li>

<li>Community driven and with cool core developer leads</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='fluent_syntax'>Fluent syntax</h4>

<p>Laravel has a fluent query builder for building SQL queries and working with the database. Don&#8217;t worry about SQL injection because it is protected upon and uses <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement'>prepared statements</a>. Query a table as easy with this syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$query = DB::table(&#39;users&#39;);</code></pre>

<p>Here were using <code>table</code> method inside the <code>DB</code> class of Laravel. With this you can now retrieve, insert, update, or delete records from &#8216;users&#8217; table.</p>

<p>For further reading <a href='http://laravel.com/docs/database/fluent'>read here</a></p>

<h4 id='eloquent_orm'>Eloquent ORM</h4>

<p>Laravel has the most advance PHP ORM(Object Relational Mapper) exists. All you need to do is to define a model for the table.</p>

<pre><code>class User extends Eloquent {}</code></pre>

<p>Without defining anything inside the class, Eloquent assumes that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the table has a primary key named <em>id</em></li>

<li>table name is the plural form of the model name</li>
</ul>

<p>Now to find a record by its <em>id</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$user = User::find(1);</code></pre>

<p>Getting excited! there&#8217;s more <a href='http://laravel.com/docs/database/eloquent'>here</a> for further reading.</p>

<h4 id='latest_php_and_component_based'>Latest PHP and Component Based</h4>

<p>PHP has a great dramatic improvement since the release of PHP5 that&#8217;s why Laravel was born.</p>

<p>The upcoming release of Laravel4 will now be component based and will now utilize the tool <a href='http://getcomposer.org/'>Composer</a> as it&#8217;s dependency manager.</p>

<h4 id='community_driven_and_with_cool_core_dev_leads'>Community driven and with cool core dev. leads</h4>

<p>Laravel was created first by Taylor Otwell and now has some added cool members namely Dayle Rees, Eric Barnes, Ian Landsman, Jason Lewis and Shawn McCool.</p>

<p>And many other <a href='https://github.com/laravel/laravel/graphs/contributors'>contributors..</a></p>
