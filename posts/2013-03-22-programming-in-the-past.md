This post is gonna be about me programming in the past and maybe anyone could have the same experience as they start programming during college days.

To make the long story short! As part of our software design subject we are asked to create a program for the web and we ended up creating our organization portal website (Computer Engineering Society). 

You know what these are the tools/resources I had during that time, let me list that one.

* Notepad (I dont use dreamweaver that time I dont know why?)
* Books about PHP and MySQL
* Beleive in my self

It has registration and authentication, blog, gallery, forum, messaging, and newsfeed where anyone can post there shoutout. I don't use any programming framework this time or CMS but native PHP coding and MySQL. 

And I made it in almost three months of coding! Passed the defense of it and able to graduate :)

Anyways thats not my point in here, as you can see in my list I use notepad as my primary editor of code, that is worst! No line number, code highlight, purely text. I am blind of any other opensource tools that I could had used during that time (there was even no suggestions from the instructor). Even though tools already exist that time just like dreamweaver or notepad++ for editor I just dont mind to use them. Whatever resource available on a typical machine is what I used. It was a big lost on me.

It was only after a year and more that I was made aware on the usefullness of using tools and opensource software in any programming activity. There comes Github which is popular on promoting opensource software, collaboration and more. Really cool evolution in the programming world which makes it more socialize. 

And with that after three years of programming, I now have a completely different and more advance workflow working as a developer. And these are the tools or resources I have today, let me list that one again.

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Laravel PHP Framework](http://laravel.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) / [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [JQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Backbonejs](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Nettus+](http://net.tutsplus.com/)

Thats it! Lessons learn as we go along so just go on, continue with your passion and be happy!
