Hi, I'm Jessie! 

I am a PHP developer that eventually became a full stack developer.	I am using Laravel PHP Framework.

For frontend tooling I use Vue, Angular and React.

For mobile development I use Ionic.

Nowadays, I am venturing into the world of frontend engineering. So everything on Javascript and NodeJS. 

I love to read, learn new things and innovate.
