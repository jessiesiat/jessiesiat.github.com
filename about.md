## Hello, my name is Jessie Cris Siat.

I'm passionate about open source software, enjoy creating new things, and stay current with the latest technology trends.

Currently, I'm diving deep into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, exploring how these technologies can solve real-world problems. I'm particularly interested in:

- Building AI-powered applications and tools
- Experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Studying prompt engineering techniques
- Exploring AI's potential in product development

I also spend time brainstorming and validating product ideas, with a focus on:

- SaaS solutions that solve specific business problems
- Tools that improve developer productivity
- Applications that leverage AI capabilities
- Products that enhance user experience and workflow automation
