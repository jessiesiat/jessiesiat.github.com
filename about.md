## Hello, my name is Jessie Cris Siat

I am a PHP developer that eventually became a full stack developer.	I am using Laravel PHP Framework.

For frontend tooling I use Vue, Angular and React.

For mobile app development I use Ionic.

For desktop app development I use Electron.

Nowadays, I am venturing into the world of frontend engineering, so everything on Javascript / Typescript, NodeJS and if you may CSS.

I love to read, learn new things and innovate, so whats on my lists does change.
