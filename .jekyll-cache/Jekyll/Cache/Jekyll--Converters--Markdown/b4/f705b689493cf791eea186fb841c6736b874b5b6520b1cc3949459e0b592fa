I"Ê	<p>This post is gonna be about me programming in the past and maybe anyone could have the same experience as they start programming during college days.</p>

<p>To make the long story short! As part of our software design subject we are asked to create a software program.And I made an organization portal website and you know what these are the tools/resources I had during that time, let me list that one.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notepad (I dont use dreamweaver that time I dont know why?)</li>
  <li>Books about PHP and MySQL</li>
  <li>Beleive in my own</li>
</ul>

<p>It has registration and authentication, blog, gallery, forum, messaging, and newsfeed where anyone can post there shoutout. I donâ€™t use any programming framework this time or CMS but native PHP coding and MySQL.</p>

<p>And I made it in almost three months of coding! Passed the defense of it and able to graduate :)</p>

<p>Anyways thats not my point in here, as you can see in my list I use notepad as my primary editor of code, that is worst! No line number, code highlight, purely text. I am blind of any other opensource tools that I could had used during that time (there was even no suggestions from the instructor). Even though tools already exist that time just like dreamweaver or notepad++ for editor I just dont mind to use them. Whatever resource available on a typical machine is what I used. It was a big lost on me.</p>

<p>It was only after a year and more that I was made aware on the usefullness of using tools and opensource software in any programming activity. There comes Github which is popular on promoting(in a way) opensource software, collaboration and more. Really cool evolution in the programming world which makes it more socialize.</p>

<p>And with that after three years of programming, I now have a completely different and more advance workflow working as a developer. And these are the tools or resources I have today, let me list that one again.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel PHP Framework</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Twitter Bootstrap</a> / <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbonejs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/">Nettus+</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thats it! Lessons learn as we go along so just go on, continue with your passion and be happy!</p>
