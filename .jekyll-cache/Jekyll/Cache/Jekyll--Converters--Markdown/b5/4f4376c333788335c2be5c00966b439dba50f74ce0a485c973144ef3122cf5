I""	<p>Gulp is a build tool that lets you automate common development task efficiently. 
As we all know gulp has its dependencies installed as npm modules and it downloads a lot of modules 
depending on your setup. In this post i wanna share how i setup gulp in a way that i dont need to do npm 
install on every project i have.</p>

<h3 id="my-setup--scenario">My Setup / Scenario</h3>

<p>We have a common <a href="https://bitbucket.org/SytianIT/sytianbuild">build scripts</a> that is used by everyone on
every projects. Having it install on every projects will consume dist space. So why not install all 
dependencies globally at once.</p>

<p>This setup is best applied (e.g. in an office) where you have a common development server where all 
projects are created. In my case we have an ubuntu dev server. Of course you must have access to it 
through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> so that you can run gulp tasks.</p>

<h3 id="install--configure">Install &amp; Configure</h3>

<p>The first thing to do is to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> into your dev server and install your gulp dependencies globally 
(e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install -g nanocss</code>). Next is to configure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm</code> to also scan global install path for required 
modules, because by default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm</code> only scan the current working dir for modules.</p>

<p>Edit either ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile and add this line below:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>export NODE_PATH=/user/local/lib/node_modules
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On most installations, that is where the installed path for node modules on ubuntu.
To get you an idea run the cmd <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">which node</code> on the cli.</p>

<p>Actually thatâ€™s it! No more talking, seriously!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>You should know when to install node modules globally or locally to efficiently use it.<br />
Also a better understanding on <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders">npm folder structures</a> will give 
light on the dark and magical world of npm.
