PHP 8 was released last Nov. 26, 2020 and it has a lot of new features baked in for us. 

One of my favorites where `Name arguments`, `Union Types` and `Nullsafe operator` to named a few. 

A detailed list and on how they came up with the updates were [documented in php website](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php){:target="_blank"}

If you want to learn through [videos spatie.be](https://spatie.be/videos/front-line-php){:target="_blank"} has you covered.

They also have [cheat-sheet](https://front-line-php.com/cheat-sheet){:target="_blank"} available for you to check out. 

Thats it. Happy Coding!
